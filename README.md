# M1 benchmark

There is a 75% chance I will go to Apple Store tomorrow and get a base model MBA with M1. 
So if you want to know the performance of that machine, I wrote a simple script to test 
it out.

## What this does

This is basically just a script to wrap [Gradle Profiler](https://github.com/gradle/gradle-profiler) 
to run through all the projects in `projects.csv`

## What is the testing condition?

- (Machine spec TBC)
- Charging
- 5 minutes between each projects
